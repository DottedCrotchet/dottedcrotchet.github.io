Birth, death, and the state of living. These will be what we will be inquiring about in this essay.

A general understanding of what life is that it is the time between the birth and death of a person, aside from your theological perspective, I think that most of the people agree with this definition. Whether it is a Semitic religion, pantheism, any spiritual or polytheistic religion, even if the spirit is immortal, there is the notion of death. Therefore, I think aside from the perspective one has, we can collectively define this as what life is. 

We will first start by pointing out various errors in the definition of life, and try to show that a definition of life can only be made in the sense which Aristotle used or a dictionary uses. 

To have a better view, let us look at what makes life valuable for people, in order to see if the relation of life and life's values are contradictory. Happiness or a general state of "serenity" are what most people define or feel is valuable about life. Drug, social media, games; any kind of addiction is based upon continuous stimulus of human perception. In a basic sense, what makes life valuable is what makes one feel as if he or she is alive, by constantly getting stimulus from a source. Which mostly is followed by depression or in extreme cases suicide when this stimulus is stopped or decreased over a time period. What is then the reason people commit suicide or get into a state of melancholy or depression, when they are not getting enough stimulus? Because one has to face oneself in times of non-stimulation. This will by no means be a shallow analysis like "people fear themselves the most" though.

What happens when people are alone? Whether one sees materialism or immaterialism as truth, I think we can safely agree on the notion that people are less alive when they are alone as opposed to being in a group of people. In the latter you are perceived as "alive" by more people, and create or live a memory with people whom you think are valuable to you. However, in the first you are self-observing and self-inquiring. People that cannot complete the process of self-inquiry mostly end up in "high stimulus" lifestyles that most of us despise. But what is that we do in this self-inquiry. 

We inquire about the inquisitor, throughout life we seldom ask ourselves, what was the process of me understanding this topic like this, or reacting to an event like that. In time of solitude, one questions this schema that one constructed since their birth. Their experiences created this schema, and they have used this ever since, and most die this way; leading a happy and serene life after all.
